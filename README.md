# Computing the isogeny class-group action on ordinary elliptic curves by going into higher dimensions

Must have [Theta Isogenies](https://github.com/ThetaIsogenies/two-isogenies/tree/main/Theta-SageMath) sage library cloned to the current directory

Unfortunately a full execution does not work at current time due to bugs in the
kernel computation.

Moreover, the computation of `wD` has bugs, and it may require some re-runs
pass this hurdle.
